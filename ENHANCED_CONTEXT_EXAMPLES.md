## 🗣️ Example Conversations

### **Basic Question → Context-Aware Response**

**User:** "What should I do today?"

**Before (Generic):** "Here are some popular attractions in your current city..."

**After (Context-Aware):** "Great question! Since you're on Day 5 in Milan today and have transport to Florence at 2:40 PM, I'd recommend focusing on the morning. You're staying at Milan Accommodation near Zara station, so you could:

1. **Morning (9-12 PM):** Visit the Duomo di Milano (it's just 15 minutes by metro from your hotel). The cathedral and rooftop views are spectacular.
2. **Early Afternoon (12-1:30 PM):** Grab lunch at Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II - it's right next to the Duomo.
3. **1:30 PM:** Head back to get your luggage and catch the M3 Yellow line to Milano Centrale for your Italo 8143 train.

Perfect timing since your train to Florence leaves at 2:40 PM!"

### **Travel Logistics → Specific Instructions**

**User:** "How do I get to my hotel from the train station?"

**Context-Aware Response:** "From Milano Centrale where your train arrives at 4:55 PM, here's exactly how to get to your Milan accommodation:

1. **Exit Milano Centrale** (follow signs for Metro M3 Yellow line)
2. **Take M3 Yellow Line** toward San Donato
3. **Get off at Zara station** (just 2 stops - about 5 minutes)
4. **5-minute walk** from Zara station to your hotel at Viale Zara 108

Total journey time: About 15 minutes
Cost: €2 for metro ticket

Your hotel is very conveniently located - you'll be able to get around Milan easily from there!"

### **Cultural Questions → Local Context**

**User:** "What are local customs I should know?"

**Context-Aware Response:** "Since you're traveling through 4 different countries, here are the key customs for each:

**In Switzerland (Interlaken):**
- Punctuality is extremely important - trains leave exactly on time
- Keep noise down on public transport
- Tipping: Round up or 5-10%

**In Italy (Milan, Florence, Rome, Venice):**
- Dress codes for churches - cover shoulders and knees
- Lunch 12:30-2:30 PM, dinner after 7:30 PM
- Stand at the bar for cheaper coffee
- Tipping: Round up to nearest euro

**In Austria (Salzburg):**
- Very formal culture - use 'Sie' (formal you) initially
- Greeting: 'Grüß Gott' instead of just 'Hallo'

**In Germany (Munich):**
- Punctuality crucial
- Quiet Sundays - shops closed
- Beer gardens: OK to sit at communal tables

Based on your itinerary, you'll especially notice the meal time differences between Swiss efficiency and Italian leisurely dining!"
